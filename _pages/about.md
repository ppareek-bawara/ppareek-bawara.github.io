<p class="lead">
I am a second year PhD student at School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University supervised by <a style="color: #5C33FF;" href="https://hunghtd.github.io/" target="https://hunghtd.github.io/"> <strong> Hung D. Nguyen </strong></a>.
Before joining NTU, I worked with <a style="color: #5C33FF;" href="http://web.iitd.ac.in/~averma/" target="http://web.iitd.ac.in/~averma/"> <strong> Ashu Verma </strong> </a> for my M.Tech in Energy Studies at Centre for Energy Studies, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IITD).</p> 

My research focus is on behavioral and operational problems of the power system. Mainly I am interested in understanding different aspects of the power system's operation under uncertainty. I am keenly interested in learning and applying new mathematical tools to solve power system problems.
