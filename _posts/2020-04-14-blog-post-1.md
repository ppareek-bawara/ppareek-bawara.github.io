This post is about my friends motivation on doing research. **_Why they chose to be travel on these unknown paths? What keeps them going when they struggle to find what they looking for?_** Or even sometimes when they are looking for what to look for. I also try to touch upon their journey so far.

The stories are told here based on what my friends want to tell. The start and end points for stories are chosen by them. I am merely a human typewriter with poor grammatical knowledge.

Juhi : ‘The Sharma ji Ki Beti’
======

Juhi is a classical case of academic excellence. Her journey is plain and simple which moves from one achievement to another smoothly. You don’t meet people like her often who performs at top level with ease. She says she is always on _“Energy Conservation Mode”_ and I cannot deny. Never met another person writing excellent pieces of academic articles while lying on bed whole day. Yet, smallest of things can be blown out of proportion, a trait common in all nerds I feel.

Her father’s transferable job made sure that she keeps moving from one school to another every three years. I am certain she made every existing topper of her new school run for their money. She studied topics in advance, cleared talent exams even without having access to so-called top city schools. An obvious next step was to go to for Indian Institute of Technology (IIT). And as many superlative degree nerds do it, she got into IIT BHU in her first attempt. No Surprise!

Well, once you become a star by clearing IIT-JEE, you just want to live it to full. The best way to do this is to waste time and chill at IIT hostels with your newly made friends for life. If your college is in Banaras, you don’t need a reason to spend time, na! But she could not resist and topped all the semester exams scoring whopping 9+ CGPA (trust me it’s a big thing), earning the title of Maggu in IIT slang. Then came peer pressure in the picture, and she started preparing for IAS. Importantly, in her department, Pharmaceutical Engineering & Technology, people thought that efforts are waste and _‘Hamara kuch nhi hoga!’_. This made her go in search of alternatives. 

The turn-around came at 3rd year. At the end of 6th semester in her curriculum, she required to do a  mandatory 3-credit internship. As she was busy in IAS preparation, she got very late in the application process and realized that she cannot apply anywhere other than my own department. Her discussions with her friends lead to the conclusion that she should take a research internship position under an excellent Professor famous for sweet nature and taking bright students. And she as she said, _“I got hooked to research as it provides me control over my working hours. I can work for days in the lab when I am in mood while completely absent for days of my choice. Also, I realized that researchers travel a lot."_ And as they say, India lost an excellent civil servant that day itself.

Next, the step was to look at what to do to get good research positions after graduation. She started applying for Foreign Intern positions, and as you can guess, she got in one through the prestigious DAAD-WISE Fellowship for the summer of 2017 at the University of Leipzig, Germany. 

Oh Boy! Her Germany trip needs an entire article of its own, if not a mini-book. In a nutshell, she says, “Due to excellent research facilities, I kept getting good results and implemented a lot of ideas. This made my interest much deeper and stronger“. She came back and started preparing for GRE, etc. Due to her habit of being a nerd, she got excellent scores without much effort. Alongside this, she kept her Master’s dissertation work going and produced good results, ending up with four research publications, a not so collective achievement. 

Every year in March, an inevitable reality strikes bright people like Juhi, called Rejections. As a person who’s talent never let them face hurdles, it is challenging to face multiple rejections. But, the nature of graduate school admission is such that your profile is not everything. The availability of funding in a particular area is the main driving factor in the Ph.D. Those three months, she said, was one of the most difficult ones she experienced. All of her friends had a job or have decided what they are going to do after May. But she was waiting for a letter, which eventually came on the 1st of May 2018. The admission offer and scholarship letter from a top university are the perfect culmination of all the hard work and endurance she has shown during her degree at IIT BHU, in a _“not so great branch.”_

Juhi is a perfect experimental researcher who somehow knows the correct amount of effort she wants to put in. Her research motivation has also been shifted from control over working hours to actually liking the research’s complete environment. Her planning runs years ahead of time, if not decades, and so is her paranoia about a possible failure. When someone says you will have a promising career, her reply will probably start from Who knows, or What if? It’s possible that this feeling drives her to work harder towards her goals. I feel she is like _Rohit Sharma (The Hitman)_. Everyone thinks it is all about her talent (even she believes she gets things without effort sometimes) because she makes it look easy to do research and Ph.D. In reality, this Sharma Ji ki Beti is also extremely hard working and focused on who gets things done due to her hard work.

Sankaran: The Experimental Physicist
======

In a nation obsessed with engineering and medicine studies, the story of a person taking an _“unorthodox looking”_ path of basic science studies, must be told. When we see people talking, _"he followed his passion and became xyz"_, the 'xyz' is mostly related to art like drama, painting, etc. How often we come to know that someone wanted to be a researcher and following his passion? My friend, Sankaran’s story, has this particular novelty in it, where passion is leading him to a very hardcore and anonymity attached to a high degree. The journey is far from over, yet I feel enough distance traveled to write a brief account of it.

In India, high-school years are considered as make or break time. The perception in that one has to perform well else you are not going to do anything significant in life, with which I strongly disagree. In those crucial years, Sankaran decided that he wants to make his own path, or at least will venture on some uncharted course. In his own words, _“I wanted to stay away from “mainstream” and urged myself to pursue a ‘job’ in life which does not feel like a mundane routine at all, rather be a daily activity driven by curiosity.”_ This thought soon culminated in the decision to study Physics, the subject that most interested him. It was an unconventional choice considering that in his entire circle, no one was studying basic sciences at that time. He says, _"I ignored the advice of many people to pursue an engineering degree and instead went on to do an integrated master’s degree in physics from the University of Hyderabad (UoH)."_

At UoH, he gave it all to excel in the courses he was taking. Yet he was considerably slow to realize the simple reality of academia. He describes it as “Even after you enter a good research-intensive university, you can’t expect anyone to gift you opportunities to do research, not even if you have top grades.” In the middle of his degree, he realized that he had not put sufficient efforts in the past two summers and ended up spending them at home while many friends joined various institutes for a summer internship.

He pulled up his socks for and a summer internship at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) the next year. This changed everything. In his words, _“I met a supervisor who in two months trained me, and it became a crash course on how to conduct research and how to publish in academia.”_ Due to his work at IISc, he got selected for a summer internship that he applied at NTU the next year, where he met an exciting research group. The hard work and motivation paid off, and just two months into the internship, his supervisor at NTU offered to take him as a Ph.D. student after he graduates the following year. The next year, a kid who thought to be unconventional was standing on stage to receive Gold Medal in UoH convocation. Fast forward two more months, and he was at NTU starting his Ph.D. in the same group where he did his internship.

During his time at NTU, Sankaran is working on ultrafast spectroscopy, which means he shoots ultra-strong lasers at materials and studies exotic processes that happen in them at ultrafast timescales, up to **0.00000000001th of a second. Ya! Let that sink in.** Why? he says, _“because its fun, and its something not many people have ever tried before.” _Something all nerd researchers think about their work.

Sankaran’s journey is like a well-crafted staircase, just in the location where people are afraid to go. His search for a perfect habitat was a step-by-step progression. He says, “At UoH, I found a few like-minded friends who shared a passion for science and inspired me and finally by joining NTU, I found a perfect research group to help him evolve as a researcher and a circle of friends (including me) who live on his “stratum of nerdy thinking.” He shares a range of interests apart from physics, including a passion for photography, lessons from the Bhagavad Gita, historical stories, facts, and has a vast collection of PJs. Sankaran is an epitome of dedication & someone  ‘mentally’ well  prepared to go long on this journey. In his own words, “fortune favors the prepared mind.”

Apoorva : One Step At A Time Girl
=====
poorva works on synthetic biology for microbial engineering. Her journey up to Ph.D. is similar to that of mine, B.Tech. from Govt. College, M. Tech. from an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) and then landing up at NTU for Ph. D. She joined here in 2019 Jan and currently in the final stages of going for her Qualification Examination. Here is how she concluded to do the Ph.D.

During her final years of UG in Biotechnology, she realized two main directions were there to move forwards.

* In Non-Science: MBA, Govt. Admin Jobs in India
* In Science : MS from abroad, Academics or Research at an Indian university

About this choice, she says, “I wanted to continue in science as I had spent two years of high school and 4 years of graduation in studying biology.” Now, like many middle-class non-IIT undergrads, the option of going abroad for MS was out due to money involvement. Fundings are less or nonexistent for MS only almost, and If you are not coming from an IIT, It is challenging to get a scholarship for Ph.D. Because of this, she prepared for GATE with a clear target to join any top institute in India to pursue her masters. About the preparation of GATE, she says, “well, that preparation made me realize that things that I studied in my graduation are kind of crap in the present scenario.” A revelation that hits you really hard for sure. Her hard work paid off, and she got what she wanted: IIT Roorkee (IITR) for M.Tech.

The IITR allowed her to explore her interest in science. In her 2nd year of M.Tech., she got the chance to work with a young assistant professor who also loved science. Reflecting on that time, she says, “He was harsh by words but loved science just like his wife, who was my labmate for some time. I always felt motivated and luckily did something meaningful in my project. I knew at that time that I liked spending time in the lab.” She was able to publish during this time and often speaks about her fond memories from IITR times. After M.Tech, she joined as an assistant professor at a private university where her job was purely teaching-oriented. This was when her decision to do a Ph. D. became firm as she says, “My experience as an Asst. Prof. at a private University made me realize two things – I loved teaching, and I missed working in the lab. And for both of these things, Ph.D. seemed to be an appropriate decision”.  She says in a nutshell, “My love for science is in the core of my reasons for doing Ph.D.”

She told me (I don’t know why), “my reasons might not look fancy enough for some kind of blog, but they are true ones.” However, I believe that they must be told as they tell the true story of the decision-making process. Her decision relied on things that are not gonna fade away soon, and this is what makes her a perfect grad student (Okay! Maybe I should ask her current advisor to endorse this last fact.)

_This picture is taken by Juhi, while we went for a trip in Phi-Phi Islands. The picture a reminder that there is always a story behind, no matter if known to few or no one, and no matter if it will only be rememberd for a short time, like these waves in Andaman Sea. The story is always Beautiful._
