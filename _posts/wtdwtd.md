This post is about my friends motivation on doing research. _Why they chose to be travel on these unknown paths? What keeps them going when they struggle to find what they looking for?_ Or even sometimes when they are looking for what to look for. I also try to touch upon their journey so far.

The stories are told here based on what my friends want to tell. The start and end points for stories are chosen by them. I am merely a human typewriter with poor grammatical knowledge.

Juhi : ‘The Sharma ji Ki Beti’
======

Juhi is a classical case of academic excellence. Her journey is plain and simple which moves from one achievement to another smoothly. You don’t meet people like her often who performs at top level with ease. She says she is always on “Energy Conservation Mode” and I cannot deny. Never met another person writing excellent pieces of academic articles while lying on bed whole day. Yet, smallest of things can be blown out of proportion, a trait common in all nerds I feel.

Her father’s transferable job made sure that she keeps moving from one school to another every three years. I am certain she made every existing topper of her new school run for their money. She studied topics in advance, cleared talent exams even without having access to so-called top city schools. An obvious next step was to go to for Indian Institute of Technology (IIT). And as many superlative degree nerds do it, she got into IIT BHU in her first attempt. No Surprise!



You can have many headings

Aren't headings cool?
